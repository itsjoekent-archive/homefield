# HomeField

HomeField is a volunteer-from-home organizing hub.

## Setup

HomeField requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run containers locally. The frontend requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v12 or greater.
To run a specific application follow the README for that project.

### Deploying

To deploy a new version or interact with a remote application from your machine, you'll need the [AWS CLI v2 installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html). Once installed authenticate by running the following,

```sh
$ aws --version # Confirm you're version is 2.0.0 or greater
$ aws configure
```
